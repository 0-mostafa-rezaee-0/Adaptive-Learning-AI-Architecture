<h1 align="center">Adaptive Learning AI Architecture</h1>

Evidence-backed adaptive learning system architecture featuring RAG-first approach with contextual bandit optimization, IRT-based learning measurement, and comprehensive 12-week implementation roadmap for scalable higher education solutions.

## 1. Quick Start

Getting started with LaTeX Development Copilot is simple:

1. **Prerequisites**: Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) or VS Code with Dev Containers extension

2. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Clone this repository 
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LaTeX-dev-copilot.git
   cd LaTeX-dev-copilot
   ```

3. **Open in Editor**:
   - Open with Cursor: `cursor .` 
   - Open with VS Code: `code .`
   - Or use the editor's GUI to open the folder

4. **Start Container (Two Methods)**:
   
   **Method 1 - Using Dev Containers (Recommended):**
   - If prompted, select `Reopen in Container`
   - If not prompted, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` then select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`
   - **Shutdown**: Simply close the editor window when finished - it will automatically handle stopping the container
   
   **Method 2 - Using Docker Compose:**
   - Start the container from the terminal: `docker-compose up -d --build`
   - **Shutdown**: Simply close the editor window when finished - it will automatically handle stopping the container
   
5. **Edit LaTeX Files**:
   - Click the play button in the top right to compile the `.tex` file. You only need to do this once - after that, it will compile automatically when you make changes
   - Open the `.pdf` file next to your `.tex` file to view your document. Unlike Overleaf, you'll see all changes update instantly in the PDF as you edit
   - All changes are automatically saved to your local workspace
   - Use Copilot and other extensions to help you write better LaTeX code
